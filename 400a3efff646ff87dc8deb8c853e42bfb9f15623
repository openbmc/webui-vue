      "message": "We are only maintaining the English translation file. Trying to manage multiple translations files is a lot of overhead and will require a lot of extra maintenance in between. It would be better to do all the translations files when the UI features are closer to done. I can CC the original contributor for the ru-RU.json",

      "message": "As I\u0027ve said in another review I don\u0027t think you need to do anything if you add new keys. This way missing keys in a Russian translation would fallback to the English default. Community (or me personally) will eventually fix it.\nI think the only thing that is needed to be checked if the keys are renamed. Some missing keys is not a problem, but when all of the keys in sections are broken because the section key was renamed this is a problem. And you don\u0027t need any Russian knowledge to fix such cases.",
