      "message": "We can do that, but we need to think how UI should behave:\n1. Pager - now, if we fetch 20 items, pager will show one page and update when more items will be downloaded. We can build pager and show all pages (we know how many items we will get), but then we need to handle scenario when user clicks on the page that we do not have. \n2. Data filters (search etc.) how should we handle scenario when user searches for something but we still getting data. Easy thing to do - block controls. Other solution - update results when new data arrive.",
