I was asked if this solution could be merged temporarily, so the app could get through Snyk security assessment. I know these changes would disappear whenever someone modify the package.json, but I was informed this will not happen soon. To fix it permanently, we need to have done some big updates to vue/cli dependency, and it is a breaking change. I tested this and it doesn\u0027t break anything.",
