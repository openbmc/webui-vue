      "message": "Gunnar, hardcoding Chassis at this level isn\u0027t ok so far as I\u0027m aware, we should be walking the full hypermedia API as intended and as Derick comments.\n\nTechnically /redfish/v1/Chassis is allowed to change, even though it\u0027s unlikely we would do that in any context, there\u0027s something to be said for following the spec to the letter.  Also, technically we could have a system that has no chassis implementation, which is something that might actually happen.\n\nIn terms of code, this works, but is going to lead to a BUNCH of code when this get moving for everything, and that code is going to be hard to optimize for speed later.  We can generisize the \"get items\" api to something like looks kinda like libredfish that takes a \"redpath\" https://github.com/DMTF/libredfish#redpath which should significantly reduce the code bloat, and make it easier to add server-side filtering once bmcweb supports it in the future.",
