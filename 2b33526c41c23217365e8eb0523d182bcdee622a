And without this change logging in is not possible at all, that\u0027s a regression (!) compared to the situation before routing restrictions were added.\n\n\u003e This may lead to displaying incorrect privilege details.\n\nWhich part of webui displays privilege details for remote users? The remote users are not listed in the \"User management\" table at all because Redfish server can not provide a list anyway.",
