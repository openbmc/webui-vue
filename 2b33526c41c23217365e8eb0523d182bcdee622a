So probably instead of storing fake role we should just leave it as `null` and instead modify the router restrictions? It looks like the code to filter navigation items is already handling this case.\n\nThis seems to be a neater approach, I\u0027ll check and get back to you, thank you.",

Given that currently the role is not shown anywere and hopefully in the future either the web ui will get the probing functionality or at least bmcweb will start reporting real role for remote users I\u0027d be tempted to keep the current patch.",
