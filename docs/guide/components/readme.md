# Overview
Vue components are the building blocks of the OpenBMC Web UI. It uses both
Boostrap-Vue components, as well as custom components. Using these components
assures consistency throughout the application. They also improve the developer
experience and increase efficiency. Review the existing components before using
HTML markup. If the feature you're working on includes a new layout pattern,
rather than adding raw markup to the page, consider creating a component that
other sections of the application can use as well.
