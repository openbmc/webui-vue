# Internationalization
The OpenBMC Web UI implements internationalization and separates the language-specific parts of the
interface from the rest of the code, so they can be easily replaced. The OpenBMC Web UI uses the following library for internationalization.
- [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/introduction.html)

## Key naming convention
This project follows the following key naming conventions.

- Page specific labels should be nested in an object with a key prefixed 'page' followed by the page title. This way it helps in keeping code structured and gives better understanding of code.
e.g. pageLocalUserManagement.editUser
- Any 'major' child components should be nested inside page specific objects (ex. table, modal)
e.g. pageEventLogs.table.eventType
- Avoid any complex linked locale messages.
- Alphabetize object keys. It helps in locating the keys.
- We use the $t() function in markup and this.$t in scripts (that Vue I18n provides to our components) for outputting translation messages.

## Using Vue I18n plugin
- A new src/i18n.js file is added and it registers Vue I18n as a plugin to our Vue instance via the Vue.use()function.
- The CLI created a src/locales/en.json file and that contains our default translation messages.
- The keys are placed in the src/locales/en.json file and then $t() function is used to output the transalation messages.
```json
"pageDumps": {
  "dumpsAvailableOnBmc": "Dumps available on BMC"
}
```

```Vue
<page-section :section-title="$t('pageDumps.dumpsAvailableOnBmc')">
```

- Vue I18nâ€™s $tc() function can help with displaying plurals.

```json
"modal": {
  "deleteDump": "Delete dump | Delete dumps"
}
```

```JS
this.$bvModal
  .msgBoxConfirm(this.$tc('pageDumps.modal.deleteDumpConfirmation'), {
   title: this.$tc('pageDumps.modal.deleteDump'),
   okTitle: this.$tc('pageDumps.modal.deleteDump'),
   cancelTitle: this.$t('global.action.cancel'),
  })
```
