# Motion
The motion guidelines are based on Carbon Design System guidelines. These
guidelines avoid easing curves that are unnatural, distracting, or purely
decorative. [The documentation below is attributed to Carbon's animation
documentation](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/motion/basics/).


## Easing

### Productive motion
Productive motion creates a sense of efficiency and responsiveness, while
remaining subtle and out of the way. Productive motion is appropriate for
moments when the user needs to focus on completing tasks.

### Expressive motion
Expressive motion delivers enthusiastic, vibrant, and highly visible movement.
Use expressive motion for significant moments such as opening a new page,
clicking the primary action button, or when the movement itself conveys a
meaning. System alerts and the appearance of notification boxes are great cases
for expressive motion.

### Easing tokens
```
$standard-easing--productive: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0.38, 0.9);
$standard-easing--expressive: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.14, 0.3, 1);
$entrance-easing--productive: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.38, 0.9);
$entrance-easing--expressive: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.3, 1);
$exit-easing--productive: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 1, 0.9);
$exit-easing--expressive: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.14, 1, 1);
```

## Duration
Duration is calculated based on the style and size of the motion. Among the two
motion styles, productive motion is significantly faster than expressive motion.
Motionâ€™s duration should be dynamic based on the size of the animation; the
larger the change in distance (traveled) or size (scaling) of the element, the
longer the animation takes.

### Duration tokens
```
$duration--fast-01: 70ms; //Micro-interactions such as button and toggle
$duration--fast-02: 110ms; //Micro-interactions such as fade
$duration--moderate-01: 150ms; //Micro-interactions, small expansion, short distance movements
$duration--moderate-02: 240ms; //Expansion, system communication, toast
$duration--slow-01: 400ms; //Large expansion, important system notifications
$duration--slow-02: 700ms; //Background dimming
