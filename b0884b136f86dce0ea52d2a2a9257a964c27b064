Our server throws a 401 here because the token was not saved anywhere and restored before this call.\n\nWhen using X-Auth-Token nothing works on browser reset or even page reload, basically, OWASP prohibits saving data used for authentication in any storage that\u0027s accessible to JS. So page reloads without losing session is only possible with an HttpOnly cookie.\n\n\u003e I see now that we have not yet picked up your cookie patches for bmcweb.

Agreed that these changes are needed.\n\nI wonder though how obtaining the role (this patch) is related to authentication mechanism? With X-Auth-Token you can not reload the page but getting role this way should still work. Please note bmcweb used to /not/ support that Roles attribute in the Session object, for that I was adding some other patches (now all upstream).",
