      "message": "is there documentation the proposed  UX (user experience)?\n\n\nI could see a few potential flows:\n  BMC contacts server, should display resolved IP and retrieved public key , and the fingerprint picture \n  UI offers input box for user to paste public key\n  UI offers box for user to fill and button to fetch with a fetch public key (combining the above)\n  UI contacts ssh server vs BMC to retrieve public key \n  \nif you trigger the model in the URL then you have already submitted the update to the BMC before it\u0027s authorized and will fail for lack of authorization.\n\nunlike the aggregation source resource commented the server in uri isn\u0027t likely to be known from prior interaction",
