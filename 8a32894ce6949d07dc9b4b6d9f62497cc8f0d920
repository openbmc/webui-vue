We would have to update all pages that have a select box to not use Bootstrap for select boxes for instance and use pure Vue3 versions.  Same for tooltips and modals.",

We came to the conclusion that moving to BootstrapVueNext could be accomplished sooner with significantly less effort.  However, that did not happen in a timely manner.\n\nInternally we already have the entire WebUI moved to Bootstrap 5 in a single MR. However we decided to upstream here just with Overview and include fallback support for all other pages.  This should allow us to thoroughly review this approach and once committed, allow us to quickly update the rest of webui.\n\nThe removal of bootstrap tags and restoration of HTML5 tags in the markup is worth the effort.",

We could use it and then fill the compatibility gaps though, which is really what the plugin does.\n\nWe have seemingly made the decision to stick with both Bootstrap and Vue, and these two libs do not have fully compatible javascript.  The move to Vue 3 requires us to move on from bootstrap-vue.  So either we work around that by creating our own compatibility layers or use something off the shelf that has more momentum.  Using BootstrapVueNext indeed puts us in the same position of depending on a third party plugin and we will have to deal with that going forward, but we would be in the same pickle if we instead hack around the incompatibilities ourselves.  Plus there would be a lot of effort to make that work; Dynamically creating and styling shadow-DOM dropdowns that work across all browsers is no picnic... and really we should be more focused on content.  The pain point would continue to be package versioning in the project.",

IBM had proposed moving to the recommended packages (Vite \u0026 Pinia). Hence in the IBM downstream, we worked on the migration to Vue3 using Vite and Pinia, rather than adopting the migration build path. \n\nHowever, we have been engaged in supporting for any upstream reviews. In downstream, we have completed about 95% of the migration work and haven\u0027t seen any issues with the Vue3 + BootstrapVueNext combination.\n\nGiven that the migration in upstream hasn\u0027t progressed much, we can now start exploring contributing our BootstrapVueNext implementation back to the community.\n\nAlso, I agree with Jason that BootstrapVueNext provides a much more convenient approach compared to using Bootstrap alone.",
