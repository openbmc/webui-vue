      "message": "I already did test works of these apis.They works well.\nLikewise,the function of \"delete\" api is not have impact because of parameter\u0027 name \nwhich has been changed to \u0027config\u0027 from \"payload\".However, the meaning of \"config\" and \"payload\" is entirely different.If you like, please pass my commit.\nThanks!",
