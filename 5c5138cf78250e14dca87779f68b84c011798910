The project had no local prettier configuration matching CI\u0027s settings\n2. the pre-commit hooks were broken (yorkie was removed during Vite migration but lint-staged remained orphaned).\n\nFix: Added .prettierrc.yaml matching CI configuration, installed simple-git-hooks to restore working pre-commit hooks, and formatted all affected files.",
