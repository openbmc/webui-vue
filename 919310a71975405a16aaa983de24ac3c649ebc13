System dumps are large disruptive dumps that are offloaded and I don\u0027t expect will rarely if ever be listed in this table. There was some discussion that they may be listed if there was an issue offloading, but I am not sure we need this filter option. \n\nSince this story has been waiting for such a long time, I think we need to make a story to investigate, rather than delaying this story.",

Since this is tested and about to receive a +2, but I have some concerns about the backend and am waiting for feedback from Dhruv to determine if these values are required and if they are, how that impacts the availability of this dump. If password and resource selector are required, this is a service login only function and we will need to discuss if this should be a downstream change only.\n\nIf not, we need to know the expectation for formatting the string to pass in the payload.",
