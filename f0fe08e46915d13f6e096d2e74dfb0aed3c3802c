We do have a standard we follow when it comes to language and so far the community has agreed to the content that IBM has contributed. However, I do know that Factory Reset has some language that is IBM specific and no one has objected to that page moving forward. I am not sure how we are going to support some of these cases that are inevitably going to surface.\n\n\n\u003e \u003e - If another company changes the us file, the translation will no longer match\n\u003e \n\u003e Yes.....  This is the advantage of an open source project.  When people add things, it helps everyone, and doesn\u0027t need explicit buy in from any company.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the contributor that changes the language needs to be responsible for providing the translation for all supported languages impacted by their change? I am not sure what to do about the translation files. Maybe each company translates on their own and translated files remain downstream only. IBM will send the English file for translation after code freeze before a release. The moment anything is changed in the English file the all the translated files are out of sync. Have any thoughts on that?\n \n\n\u003e \u003e \u003e Also, what do the env variables do?  How are they used?
