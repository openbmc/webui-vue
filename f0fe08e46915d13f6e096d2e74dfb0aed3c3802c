Having different \"rules\" (if you can call them that) in different repos is counter productive to people that need to submit to multiple repos.  For example, if I were submitting here, I would\u0027ve tested my change in the github UI, and pushed it, without ever realizing that VuePress was used.  Because they\u0027re both markdown, maybe it wouldn\u0027t have mattered, but the webui shouldn\u0027t be inventing its own documentation format disparate from the rest of the project.  That\u0027s counterproductive.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I don\u0027t know what you mean by \"the github one\". If you are saying just using markdown in GitHub similar to the docs repo, we felt that the theming and formatting of documentation as browser based documentation was much easier to navigate and share expected patterns.\n\u003e \n\u003e https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/#how-it-works\n\nYes, I mean the existing markdown like the docs and all other source repos use.  If vuepress is really that much better, it should be easy to convince people that it should be used project-wide, not just here.  Barring that, consistency as a project is a good thing and should be prioritized over every repo having their own theming;  If only one repo of the docs are themed, and the rest aren\u0027t, it makes for a very messy experience overall.\n\nWith that said, you\u0027re the maintainer here, so it\u0027s up to you.",

However, there is company specific copy out there and we still don\u0027t have a clear plan how that will be managed. No one has pushed back or even reviewed outside of IBM. We are trying to collaborate on this and resolve as much as possible to resolve downstream work, but there is a large number of variables to consider. For example, these are just two concerns:\n\u003e \u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e - will everyone be planning to use the translated files that IBM is providing?\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Personal opinion, OpenBMC should have a base set of translations, and not be company specific.  I would really hope that the same string translated to a different language wouldn\u0027t be dependent on which company wrote the change.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e If IBM needs specific translations for IBM specific features, I would expect that to go under IBM specific feature flags.\n\u003e \n\u003e It all depends on the translator regarding to how a string is translated. We do have a standard we follow when it comes to language and so far the community has agreed to the content that IBM has contributed. However, I do know that Factory Reset has some language that is IBM specific and no one has objected to that page moving forward. I am not sure how we are going to support some of these cases that are inevitably going to surface.\n\nSounds like a future design doc, but \"I need something specific and non-standard for my company\" I think should be separated from \"I need multi language support\".  The default should be to find consensus in openbmc where we can.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e - If another company changes the us file, the translation will no longer match\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Yes.....  This is the advantage of an open source project.  When people add things, it helps everyone, and doesn\u0027t need explicit buy in from any company.\n\u003e \n\u003e This leads me to believe that the contributor that changes the language needs to be responsible for providing the translation for all supported languages impacted by their change?\n\nNo, I would expect only the languages they care about.  I\u0027m not the maintainer here, but expecting every submitter to know every language seems a big constraining.  I would expect the submitter to make the accommodations for the default language (I\u0027m assuming english) to prove that the code works, then those that care about the other languages can add the appropriate support.  Although, again, I\u0027m not the maintainer here.\n\n\u003e I am not sure what to do about the translation files. Maybe each company translates on their own and translated files remain downstream only.\n\nThis seems like a kinda odd policy, and at odds with collaboration.  In open source, I don\u0027t really want to speculate on your \"downstream\" that\u0027s your business, and has no bearing on what we do here.  For those that need the translations, upstream the various languages, and make sure there are reasonable fallbacks in place in code.  If the community thinks a language should be supported, it\u0027ll get a config file, if the community doesn\u0027t care, it will be incomplete.  If a language is incomplete to the point where it\u0027s not useful, it will be removed.\n\n\u003e IBM will send the English file for translation after code freeze before a release. The moment anything is changed in the English file the all the translated files are out of sync. Have any thoughts on that?\n\nI see two paths here:\n\n1. Before allowing a new language in, make sure specific maintainers are assigned for each language in question, and set the expectation that they\u0027ll provide translations for new strings within X months of being checked into master, and ahead of releases.  If no maintainer presents themselves willing to do that, I would expect the new language to be barred from master.  FWIW, when we check in multiple languages of message registry into Redfish (as is allowed in the standard), this option will be my preference, where I am the maintainer.\n\n2. Alternatively, maintain feature flags for every conceivable option, and have cross reference checks between the required strings and the option itself, and only allow a language to be enabled if it\u0027s complete.  This seems hard to do given the level of detail you would need, but could also get you a result if you don\u0027t want to assign language maintainers.\n\nI personally think the first option is better, and more open source friendly, as anyone can upstream new definitions, and the code works as well as people care to make it.  It also conveys ownership to people, which I think is helpful.\n\n\u003e  \n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e Also, what do the env variables do?  How are they used?  Why would someone wanting internationalization use them?\n\u003e \u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e No one will internationalize or translate the .env variables. They are used for companies to be able to use a configuration to change the theme, navigation, and routing if they need something the rest of the community does not.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e If they\u0027re not used for internationalization.... why are they mentioned in the internationalization document?
