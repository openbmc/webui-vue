This will solve one issue, but we still have navigation challenges to handle. We also are hard coding navigation (vue router) and it is likely that we would need to manage the vue routes dynamically also based on the availability of Redfish properties. The way we are accomodating that currently is by creating custom routing to exclude or include routes and navigation.\n\nI am not quite sure what is meant by the configuration option for this page. I apologize if it\u0027s obvious and I am just missing it.",
