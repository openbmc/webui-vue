There are 1824 models generated from the latest Redfish openapi.yaml file.\nThe parent [86518](https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/webui-vue/+/86518) added AccountService but here I updated the pre-commit script to also include *all* dependencies recursively for each model, hence we have a lot of AccountService stuff added here as well.\n\nThese are not built in to the image, and are not even needed to compile, they are purely for Typescript IDE/Agent support.  But I thought I would keep the number down and create a script to only commit the models that are currently being used.",

      "message": "When I searched for a term matching the \"Id\" column (only visible in expanded mode), then clicked \"Show less\", the search results didn\u0027t update even though the Id column was now hidden.\nThis is because TanStack Table\u0027s global filter was memoized based on the filter string value. When showMore toggled:\n- The columns changed (Id column added/removed)\n- But the filter string stayed the same\n- TanStack returned cached results, ignoring the column change\n\nI moved global filtering from TanStack into the filteredSensors Vue computed, which explicitly depends on columns.value. Now when showMore changes → columns changes → the computed re-evaluates → search results update correctly.\nThis leverages Vue\u0027s reactivity system instead of fighting TanStack\u0027s memoization.",
