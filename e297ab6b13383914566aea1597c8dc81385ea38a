      "message": "Hello Jason,\n\nThank you for the well-thought and nicely commented patch. I wonder what was your motivation, are you going to add handling for more messages soon, which ones?\n\nAs a side note, it will conflict with https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/webui-vue/+/74147 which I hope to see approved soon.\n\nI think since this check for the expired password message needs to be performed in two different places we still need a helper function to avoid code duplication and make intent more clear and self-contained.\n\nAlso, I\u0027m not sure having that registry default parameter is going to work in a non-confusing way as parameters are still assigned left to right and if the caller specifies just two the registry will get assigned while key will remain undefined. `key\u003d\u0027Base\u0027` in the doxygen comment looks confusing too.",

      "message": "\u003e are you going to add handling for more messages soon, which ones?\n\nYes!  Specifically, for handling the next steps when polling Task responses during a firmware update.  However, we have general plans to improve feedback, especially on forms.  Nothing concrete to share yet... but would happen after the Vue3 merge.\n\n\u003e I think since this check for the expired password message needs to be performed in two different places we still need a helper function to avoid code duplication and make intent more clear and self-contained.\n\nI\u0027ll add the helper back (will make less impact!), but I don\u0027t think that we need a helper for every case going forward.\n\n\u003e Also, I\u0027m not sure having that registry default parameter is going to work in a non-confusing way as parameters are still assigned left to right and if the caller specifies just two the registry will get assigned while key will remain undefined. `key\u003d\u0027Base\u0027` in the doxygen comment looks confusing too.\n\nYeah, I struggled with that one a little.  Logically it makes sense to put the registry value before the key, but registry should default to \"Base\", I can move the assignment down and improve the JSDOC.\n\nWill update with new patch later.  Thanks for the feedback!",
