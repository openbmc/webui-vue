      "message": "Hello Jason,\n\nThank you for the well-thought and nicely commented patch. I wonder what was your motivation, are you going to add handling for more messages soon, which ones?\n\nAs a side note, it will conflict with https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/webui-vue/+/74147 which I hope to see approved soon.\n\nI think since this check for the expired password message needs to be performed in two different places we still need a helper function to avoid code duplication and make intent more clear and self-contained.\n\nAlso, I\u0027m not sure having that registry default parameter is going to work in a non-confusing way as parameters are still assigned left to right and if the caller specifies just two the registry will get assigned while key will remain undefined. `key\u003d\u0027Base\u0027` in the doxygen comment looks confusing too.",

      "message": "\u003e are you going to add handling for more messages soon, which ones?\n\nYes!  Specifically, for handling the next steps when polling Task responses during a firmware update.  However, we have general plans to improve feedback, especially on forms.  Nothing concrete to share yet... but would happen after the Vue3 merge.\n\n\u003e I think since this check for the expired password message needs to be performed in two different places we still need a helper function to avoid code duplication and make intent more clear and self-contained.\n\nI\u0027ll add the helper back (will make less impact!), but I don\u0027t think that we need a helper for every case going forward.\n\n\u003e Also, I\u0027m not sure having that registry default parameter is going to work in a non-confusing way as parameters are still assigned left to right and if the caller specifies just two the registry will get assigned while key will remain undefined. `key\u003d\u0027Base\u0027` in the doxygen comment looks confusing too.\n\nYeah, I struggled with that one a little.  Logically it makes sense to put the registry value before the key, but registry should default to \"Base\", I can move the assignment down and improve the JSDOC.\n\nWill update with new patch later.  Thanks for the feedback!",

      "message": "\u003e Restored the isPasswordExpired() helper.\n\nThank you! I think a helper should be introduced for any match that\u0027s needed in more than one place because function names get some checking and a typo would be reported while the key in a string literal can easily go unnoticed and one place can diverge from another that was actually tested.\n\n\u003e and am also leaving the default param assignment in the function as it has been valid as of ES6.  I did however move it to the third param as it is optional.\n\nYes, it would seem not idiomatic to expect your consumers to pass `undefined` as the second param with the intention of using that default. Now with it being last it does the job.\n\n\u003e is there an issue with literal Doxygen?  I don\u0027t use that for JS/TS projects.\n\nI have very little clue about JavaScript, just saw something resembling Doxygen and called it that way, sorry about the confusion.",
