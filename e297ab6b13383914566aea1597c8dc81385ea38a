      "message": "Hello Jason,\n\nThank you for the well-thought and nicely commented patch. I wonder what was your motivation, are you going to add handling for more messages soon, which ones?\n\nAs a side note, it will conflict with https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/webui-vue/+/74147 which I hope to see approved soon.\n\nI think since this check for the expired password message needs to be performed in two different places we still need a helper function to avoid code duplication and make intent more clear and self-contained.\n\nAlso, I\u0027m not sure having that registry default parameter is going to work in a non-confusing way as parameters are still assigned left to right and if the caller specifies just two the registry will get assigned while key will remain undefined. `key\u003d\u0027Base\u0027` in the doxygen comment looks confusing too.",
