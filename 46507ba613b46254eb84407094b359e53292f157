When loaded on the bmc, this error doesn\u0027t seem to present anymore.  This is one of the things that needs debugged at some point.\n\n\u003e With the migration build,\n\u003e we can get multiple error and might try to resolve each error. We are not sure how many will come and are we fixing those errors in correct way!\n\nThere\u0027s pretty heavy documentation on each warning, and how to move it forward.  I agree, it\u0027s a difficult problem, but we certainly can\u0027t rewrite the webui in a single patch, and attempting it means that nobody else can contribute while the vue3 change is happening, which I suspect is part of what has stalled this transition for so long (among other things).\n\n\u003e BootstrapVue is not supported in vue3, After removing @vue/compact, We need to move to Bootstrap Vue-next.\n\nI\u0027m assuming you mean @vue/compat.  We should drop the vue-bootstrap dependencies alltogether, and use the default css from the bootstrap project.  Bootstrap 5 has dropped the jquery dependency, so there\u0027s no real reason for us to pull in any bootstrap vue specific module anymore.  Breaking this need for a vue specific bootstrap module will help us a lot in the long run if we decide we want to move to another framework, react, server-side rendering, or all manner of things.",
