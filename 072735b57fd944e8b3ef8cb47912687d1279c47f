      "message": "Yes, since vitest is built-in to Vite, there is no duplicate configuration or separate babel/webpack setup.  Plus Vite has a Jest-Compatible API, which you can see in many spots in this patch.  It also has first-class TypeScript support, which will become important once we land codegen from Redfish API (and that PR is UP!)",

      "message": "You could add a bit more to the commit msg if you want. You could also link a site or two that compares them. I think this is a no-brainer since we are using Vite, vitest is faster, near zero config and modern. The bigger ecosystem / more plugins argument for Jest seems to also hold less weight as the vitest ecosystem has continued to grow.",
