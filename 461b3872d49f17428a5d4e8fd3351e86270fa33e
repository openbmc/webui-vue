      "message": "That is indeed correct...this change was more to protect against the root user being disabled/deleted unintentionally in case there are a lot of users in the list and the user does the \"select all\" and proceeds to delete/disable all of them. If the root is unselected, the user has a second chance to delete/disable the root if that was their intent after the previous operation has completed.",

The individual row for root user has the \"delete\" icon disabled. I have been wary of seeing what happens if the user selects all the users and deletes them. Does the backend process the request to delete the root user or simply ignore it? If the backend processes the request to delete the root user, and the individual row had delete icon disabled, doesn\u0027t it stand to reason that the same should apply from the table checkbox itself?\n3. The whole idea is to not allow the root user to be deleted (or should we allow the root to be deleted, is there a spec point regarding this?). We protected against that happening by disabling the delete icon on the root user row, now it is a question of not allowing it through other means on the GUI.",
